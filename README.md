This repository contains code and supporting information relating to an architecture for interactive learning of domain knowledge in a robotics context.

    The file 'Accuracy-summary-data.txt' summarizes precision and recall data for experimental trials in learning axioms.
    The file 'Noise-Data-Full.pdf' summarizes precision and recall data for experimental trials in learning axioms with simulated actuator noise.
    The file 'example_ASP_domain.sp' gives a CR-Prolog implementation of the robotic domain representation used in the paper.
    The file 'README.md' is this file.
    The other files contain the qRRL code. Begin with 'readme_QRRL_build_instructions.txt'.
